## ðŸ“¡ FactSift

FactSift uses a Google Search wrapper to fetch relevant news URLs in real time. Each article undergoes the following process:

1. **Content Extraction**: Web pages are loaded and parsed into clean text.
2. **Quality Scoring**: Each document is evaluated for:
   - **Source credibility** (e.g., `reuters`, `bbc`, `cnn`, `hindustantimes` etc.)
   - **Recency** (based on how many days old it is)
   - **Content length** (ideal size range)
3. **Semantic Ranking**: LangChain's vector store performs similarity search against the user query.
4. **Score Fusion**: For each document, a **final score** is computed using the formula:

### Final Document Score

final_score = Î± * similarity_score + Î² * credibility_score

Î± = 0.8, Î² = 0.2

```python
final_score = 0.8 * similarity_score + 0.2 * quality_score
```
